# BJTU Web Search & Recommendation 2023 (M502075B/C402005B)

Demo code for news click-through rate prediction competition.

## Base Model

#### 1.  Framework

The framework of base model for news recommendation, it consists of several parts: (1) a news encoder that uses rich textual content to learn news embeddings, and all news encoder parameters are shared; (2) a cheap sequential behavior moduel learns user embeddings from news click history; (3) a prediction  moduel calculates predictive scores using the dot product of user embeddings with candidate news embeddings.
